# TypeScript CRUD CLI Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built using TypeScript. The app interacts with a JSON file (`db.json`) for storing data. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the JSON file, simulating a small database.

- **Read**: View all stored items.
- **Update**: Modify an existing item's details.
- **Delete**: Remove an item from the store by its ID.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
